I am a Senior Lecturer in IT at the School of Information Technology, Faculty of Science, Engineering and Built Environment, Deakin University Australia. Prior to joining Deakin University in 2019, I worked as a lecturer at Federation University Australia and sessional teaching staff at various institutions. Before moving to academia, I worked in industry as a data engineer and software developer for several years. I received my PhD from Monash University, Australia. My research is in the areas of Data Mining (DM), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am interested in applying ML/AI concepts to solve real-world problems in different domains, particularly in defence, cyber security, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and engineering. I work in a wide range of areas in ML/AI from similarity measures, anomaly detection, classification, clustering, text/image analysis, ensemble learning, learning from small subsamples of data, and robust/explainable machine learning to autonomous systems. I have published more than 35 scientific papers in top tier conferences and journals in the field of DM/ML and have been a named investigator on research grants and contracts of over two millions. My research is supported by US Defence (AFOSR and ONR Global), Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group Australia, and Office of National Intelligence (ONI) Australia. I am part of the [<span>Machine Learning for Decision Support (MLDS) Research Group</span>](https://deakin-mlds.github.io/index.html) at the Deakin University School of Information Technology.
